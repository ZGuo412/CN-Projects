# Computer-Networks
ece463 course in Purdue University which focused on computer networks and security

This course contains two lab I need to finish.

For the first lab, I create network applications on top of the transport layer using socket programming. I build a modified HTTP client and a modified HTTP server. Then I make my server to respond to concurrent requests and handle not only HTTP requests, but also multiple services like UDP pinging.

For the Second lab, I implement a simplified version of the path vector protocol. I used two thread in this project.
